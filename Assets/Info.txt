When you've got an item you'd like to pick up, simply drop a NVRInteractableItem component on it. You'll need to give it a Rigidbody (and ideally set the mass) if you haven't already. If the item has a specific point that you'd like to pick it up at you can create a new GameObject, parent it to your item, and position it in the location and at the rotation that you'd like the controller to be. Then set NVRInteractableItem.InteractionPoint to that new gameobject.
